# T10: Dynamical friction

## Before Class

- What is dynamical friction? How does it work?
  - Dynamical friction is a physical phenomenon that occurs in a system of moving particles, where a massive object moving through the system experiences a deceleration due to the gravitational interactions with the surrounding particles.
  - When a massive object, such as a star or a galaxy, moves through a system of smaller particles, it creates a gravitational disturbance in its vicinity. This disturbance causes the smaller particles to be pulled toward the massive object, resulting in an accumulation of particles in its wake. As a result, the smaller particles exert a gravitational drag on the massive object, causing it to slow down over time.
  - The dynamical friction force experienced by the massive object is directly proportional to its mass and velocity, and inversely proportional to the mass of the surrounding particles and their density distribution.
  - dynamical friction is an important mechanism that affects the dynamics and evolution of massive objects in systems with many smaller particles, playing a role in shaping the structure and distribution of objects in galaxies and other astrophysical systems.
