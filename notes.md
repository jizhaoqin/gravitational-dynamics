- What is Lenseâ€“Thirring precession?

  - Lense-Thirring precession is a relativistic correction to the precession of a gyroscope of a large rotating mass such as Earth.
  - The difference between Lense-Thirring and de Sitter precession is that, the de Sitter effect is due simply to the presence of a central mass, whereas the Lense-Thirring effect is **due to the rotation of the central mass**.

- where in our galaxy could it be important?

  - The Lense-Thirring effect is important in the vicinity of rotating massive objects, such as the Earth and the Sun. It is negligible for most satellites orbiting the Earth, but for satellites with orbits at a high altitude, such as the LAGEOS satellites, it is the dominant relativistic effect.
  - It is also important for the orbits of binary pulsars.
  - The Lense-Thirring effect is also important for the orbits of stars around the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

- How does it compare to Newtonian acceleration?

  - The Lense-Thirring effect is a relativistic correction to the Newtonian precession of a gyroscope of a large rotating mass such as Earth.
