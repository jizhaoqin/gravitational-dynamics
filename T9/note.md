# T9 - General N-body Problem

## Before Class

- What is the free-fall time of a homogeneous sphere?
  - The free-fall time of a homogeneous sphere refers to the time it takes for the entire sphere to collapse under its self-gravity, assuming it starts from rest and there are no external forces acting on it.
- What do the trajectories of individual tracer particles embedded in the sphere look like?
  - theoretically straight lines before collapse into the center
  - because for every particle, the outer shell implies no force on the particle, and the inner sphere acts like a point mass at every time.
- If you have a homogeneous distribution of particles, how would you set up a gravitational softening in order to avoid unwanted, numerical effects?
  - avoid collisions (merges and very close interactions)
  - regards a particle as a smoother distribution of mass than a $\delta$ distribution of mass
