# T8 - Lagrange Points

## Before Class

- What is the "restricted 3-body problem"?
  - The restricted three-body problem is a simplified mathematical model used to study the motion of a small object (such as a spacecraft or a planet) under the influence of the gravitational forces exerted by two larger objects.
  - The term "restricted" implies certain simplifications made in this model. One assumption is that the gravitational influence of the small object on the two larger objects is negligible, meaning that the small object does not significantly affect the motion of the two larger objects. Another assumption is that the motion of the two larger objects is only due to their mutual gravitational attraction, and no other external forces are considered.
  - The interactions between the two larger objects create regions of stability and instability, known as Lagrange points, where the gravitational forces of the two larger objects balance out, allowing a smaller object to remain relatively stationary with respect to them.
  - The restricted three-body problem has been used to understand various celestial dynamics, such as the motion of artificial satellites around the Earth-Moon system or the motion of moons around their host planets.
